# Virtual-Train-Route-Planner

# Project Overview
The Virtual Train Route Planner is a console-based application that allows users to navigate through train stations in real-time. It uses Doubly Linked Lists and Circular Linked Lists to represent train routes.
Users can move forward and backward between stations, and the circular nature of the route allows continuous travel (looping back to the first station after the last).

# Features
 Add new stations dynamically.
 View the current station at any time.
 Display the entire train route.
 Move forward to the next station.
 Move backward to the previous station.
 Supports circular routes (loop back after the last station).

 # Tech Used
Language: Python
Data Structures: Doubly Linked List & Circular Linked List

# How to Run
